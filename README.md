# Data-Management-System
Designed a desktop application for a company that helps them to manage employee records.

Employee records to consider should include: Employee ID, First Name, Last Name, Start Date, Start Salary, Employee Contract Signed (Y/N), Social Security Number, Birth date, Phone Number, Name of Person to Call in an Emergency, and Phone of Person to Call in an Emergency.

The User Interface (UI) of the application is in JavaFX. The company data is stored, retrieved and manipulated from MySQL database.

The application is able to support full CRUD operations. That means users should be able to create new employee records, retrieve the record of a specific employee and/or all employees, update the records of a specific employee, and delete the records of a specific employee.
